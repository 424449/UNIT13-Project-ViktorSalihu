# Design Notes
+ This document explains information for: Layout, such as sizes and positions. Typography (fonts, font sizes, font colours)

# Task
+ For this task I am asked to create two designs for my website, the first one must be a main one and the second will be an alternative.
+ The design of the website: layout.
+ Text: What fonts are used for the website, what size and colour.
+ Colours for background.
# Why alternative design was rejected
The alternative page which was Design 2, was rejected because it was looking too buffy, in order to make the page easy navigatable was to keep it simple, design 1 was chosen because was simplier and nice to use, also was easier for the designer to create it so it saved time.
# Strenghts and Weaknesses
+ The strenghts of the website are the detail the designer have put on it, the pictures that are with reduced prices are with a label on the left side and also there is a whole page for just these products. The one of the phones, and to be exact the iPhone 12 pro, the blue one on the home page, its page has more details than the other pages, it has a video, without selecting a storage you are not able to buy the phone.
+ The weaknesses are the buttons, the buttons which are the navigation buttons are not designed very nice, the designer didnt work to much with because the gola was to be functional and not pretty, the buttons are just underlined text which tekes us to the specific page.
The fonts are not creative enough, they are juts basic fonts.

# Updates
## Product Page
+ Instead of one picture for product, they have been changed to two.
+ Every single product has a table explaining specifications and any added features.
## Contact Us Page

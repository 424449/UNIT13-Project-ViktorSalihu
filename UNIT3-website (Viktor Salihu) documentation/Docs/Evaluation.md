# Why the website is suitable for the audience
The website is based for customers interested in buying technology, especially phones, but in the website can be found product like laptops, smart watches and earphones. It is easy navigatable and fast loading.
# People with vision difficulties
The website is responsive and it can be zoomed, in that way the text enlarge itself and can be read by people with vission difficulties, also the webpage is not made with to many different colours because of colourblind people, I wanted to make it universal for everyone so the white is white and the grey will be grey in everyone's vission.
# Changes
## Button on "Contact Us" page 
The button on Contact us page was removed becuase was causing bug to the website, the goal was to make the website quick to load.
## Dropdown
The dropdown on the design was ment to be placed at the right end of the website, the dropdown was placed to the left end of the website displaying "All Products" That one beneffited with the consistency of the webpage, the design was looking better.
## The button "buy"
The button buy at every product page was changed to "Buy for (price)" displaying above the button the name of the product on the top of the name was placed the logo of the company, this was benefficial because it was a creative way to put the price on.
## Logo 
The logo on the header of the page was removed, it was benefficial to the responsivness of the webpage, because of the logo the page was having difficulties with making the page actually smaller.
# Solutions I have done
Because the page was unresponsive for unknown reason, when I was trying to minimize or zoom into the page, the page was getting wider, so you can scroll sideways, I figured out what was the issue and that was the logo on the header of the document, I have removed it so my page can be responsive.

# Feedback
Here are my feeback gave by my two classsmates, the task is to colect some feedback from from two or more of other people. They have to check it functionality and criticise it.
|No.|Name|Feedback|
|---|------:|-------|
|1|Vasil|The page looks alright but you could add a bulky look to the navigation buttons, so they can look like actual button because now they look like links, the page is a little bit empty because it has no background picutres.
|2|Armandas|It misses some details to the logo when you buy a phone from the website, the picture looks squashed, you can also putting somem ore information in about us section.
